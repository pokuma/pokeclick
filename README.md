## Description
Our project consists of a web application that allows the user to play a game similar to the famous Cookie Clicker, but with a Pokémon theme. The game consists of clicking on Pokémon to defeat them to gain money, xp, and have a chance to catch the pokemon. Money can then be used to buy items that give you more damage. The game does not have an end, but the main objective is to catch all the 151 Pokémon in the Kanto Pokédex.
The features and different pages that we have implemented are:
* A register and login system that should allow the user to save their progress and continue playing from where they left off. (This feature is not implemented, but all the front-end is done).
* A dark mode that can be toggled on and off
* An options menu
* A shop where the user can buy items to increase their damage
* A Pokédex where the user can see the Pokémon they have caught
* The main game loop where the user can click on Pokémon to defeat them and catch them and gain money and xp
* A full tutorial that explains how to play the game and a button to replay it if needed
* The ability to reset your progress
* A FAQ page with some insights on the game
